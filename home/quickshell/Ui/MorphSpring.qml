// The island's shape spring: one critically damped spring, so it never overshoots, solved
// exactly for each frame's own time step.
// SpringAnimation steps in fixed 16 ms quanta, so on a 120 Hz output a morph only moved on
// every other frame; this moves on every one, and lands on the same curve at any frame rate.
//
// Bind `target`, read `value`. A new target keeps the velocity, as a spring should. With
// `animate` down a new target is taken at once and any motion stops, which is what writing
// through a disabled Behavior does, so the `snapping` idiom in Ui/IslandOrigin.qml carries over.
